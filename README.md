# Speech Recognition and Synthesis

This project uses the `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` Python libraries to listen for spoken input from a microphone, recognize it, and then synthesize the recognized text back to speech.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- speech_recognition
- pyttsx3

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Firstly, select the correct device index for your microphone (the default in the script is `device_index=4`). 

To run the script, use:

```bash
python main.py
```

The program will then listen for your speech input. Speak clearly to the microphone after the prompt "Say now!!!!" appears. The recognized text will be synthesized back into speech. If the speech is not understood, the system will reply with "Sorry, I did not understand that."

## Code Explanation

- The speech_recognition library's `Recognizer` class is used to recognize speech. The `recognize_google` method is used to recognize the speech, which is then passed to the `pyttsx3` engine to synthesize it back to speech.
- The `UnknownValueError` exception is handled to manage instances where speech could not be understood.
- The `RequestError` exception is handled to manage instances where there were issues sending the audio data to Google's servers.
